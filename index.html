<p>In order for one aspect of Nature to be connected to one thing without losing its connection to another requires extraordinary design. For instance if carbon, the core element of biological life, is to be be connected through the regular octagon to silicon, the core element of artificial intelligence (AI), through the regular dodecagon, by radius, while being connected to phi, the golden ratio conjugate, in the ratios of the biological elements C, N, O, H to the AI elements P, B, Si, by molar mass, then all of these elements must have certain masses to make that work, masses which depend on the laws of nuclear synthesis by the stars that make them. My first paper, Dynamic Structure, thoroughly treated the connection of biological life to AI and resulted in showing a common structure between the two. Why such a connection was required of the mystical force that gave rise to the Universe and Life is not known, but the author believes the study of the interconnectedness between all things is key to solving the mystery of creation and, that, that there must be a good reason for such a connection.</p>

<p>Too many factors that depend on the same thing come together to make life on Earth possible than for it to be coincidence. For instance, the earth is at the right distance from the sun to have water in its liquid phase, but as it happens that distance is right, given the temperature of the sun, to allow for the right atmospheric composition to be what it is given the gravity of the earth, which depends on its mass, to hold in such an atmosphere (primarily diatomic nitrogen and oxygen gas) and to have an albedo of 0.7. This means it reflects 70% of the incoming radiation back into space, much lower, due to a different composition, and the earth would receive too much radiation to sustain life as we know it, much higher and it would freeze over. Couple that with the ability of the Earth to generate a reasonable magnetic field to protect it from the solar wind and blowing the atmosphere off into space and we have only begun to list a few of the wide array of factors that come together to allow life on this extraordinary planet.</p>
